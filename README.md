# DigameApp
A simple dictionary app. The user inputs any acronym (string casing does not matter) and the chat bot will return a definition based on a word bank it's given. The UI is created with streamlit and is simple. There's a gif of snoopy flipping thorugh a book and an input text box. After the user types in their acroynm a response appears.
